## Identification of Networks of Dynamic Systems

**Speaker**: [Michel Verhaegen](https://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/~mverhaegen/)

**Abstract**: This presentation consists of two parts. First an overview will be given of the new book "M. Verhaegen, Y. Chengpu and B. Sinquin, "Data-Driven Identification of Networks of Dynamic Systems", Cambridge University Press 2022". In this book a framework is defined to identify large scale networks of dynamical systems with special attention to the structural element to parametrize these large scale networks and efficiently estimating these parameters. Then in the second part we zoom in into a critical problem to identify local systems operating in such large scale networks using local data and local methods only. The latter creating the possibility to implement these methods in a distributed fashion.
