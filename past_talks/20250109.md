## On the Optimality of Sparse Feedback Control under Architecture-Dependent Communication Delays


**Speaker**: [Luca Ballotta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0Fv9vH8AAAAJ&hl=it)

**Abstract**: Distributed control of multi-agent and large-scale systems is a well-established paradigm to tradeoff control performance for practical feasibility and costs. However, the profound connection between distributed architecture and control performance is often elusive in realistic scenarios. In this talk, I investigate the effects of communication delays that increase with the number of links in a distributed controller architecture. Specifically, I consider a distributed consensus task with stochastic and deterministic dynamics where the control design respectively minimizes the steady-state variance and maximizes the speed of convergence.  Contrary to the common belief that more complex controllers provide better performance, these scenarios yield that the optimal controllers may exhibit sparse communication, shedding new light on optimal control design under real-world communication.
