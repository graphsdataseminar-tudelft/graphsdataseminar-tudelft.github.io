**Abstract**: 
Ortec Finance is a fintech company specialized in creating mathematical modeling tools for financial decision-making. Within its R&D department, we conduct research into both classical (econometric) and machine-learning-based techniques to improve our models. During this talk, we will dive into various domains within machine learning that are relevant to our financial applications and discuss how these can intersect with graph-based approaches. Moreover, one of our former graduate students, Aratrika Das, will give an overview of her thesis on applying graph neural networks in the context of real estate valuation.
