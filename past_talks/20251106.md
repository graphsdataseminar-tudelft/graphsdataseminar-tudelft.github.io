## Node Metrics in Complex Networks: Foundations, Perspectives and Applications


**Speaker**: [Sergey Shvydun](https://www.nas.ewi.tudelft.nl/index.php/sergey-shvydun) 

**Time:** 15:00 - 15:45

**Location:** Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) HG 2.62


**Abstract**: 
Understanding the structural role of nodes in complex systems is crucial for identifying influential individuals in social networks, critical components in infrastructure, essential proteins in biological networks and high-impact pages or users in information networks. Over the years, a large number of node metrics have been proposed to capture different aspects of network structure. However, the abundance of available metrics has introduced significant challenges, particularly in selecting, comparing and validating these measures. In this talk, we will review existing approaches for quantifying structural roles and their applications, discuss key challenges and limitations and present an interactive platform for exploring and comparing graph metrics.
