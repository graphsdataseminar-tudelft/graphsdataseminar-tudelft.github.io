## From Spaces to Graphs: Spatial Data Representation


**Speaker**: [Seyran Khademi](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab/people/seyran-khademi) 

**Time:** 15:00 - 15:45

**Location:** Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences LB 01.170 Timmanzaal


**Abstract**: 
Architectural and urban spatial data are conventionally represented through geometryâ€”coordinates, dimensions, and visual fidelity. Yet, when the objective shifts from drawing space to reasoning about it, geometry becomes secondary to topology, where relationships, adjacency, connectivity, and circulation patterns hold the primary semantic meaning.
This talk introduces a topological modeling perspective for spatial datasets, employing graph representations and graph neural networks to distill and interpret the latent structure of spatial organization beyond traditional geometric descriptions.
