**Abstract**:  
Learning the topology of higher-order networks from data is a fundamental challenge in many signal processing and machine learning applications. Simplicial complexes provide a principled framework for modeling multi-way interactions, yet learning their structure is challenging due to the strong coupling across different simplicial levels imposed by the inclusion property. In this work, we propose a joint framework for simplicial complex learning that enforces the inclusion property through a linear constraint, enabling the formulation of the problem as a binary linear program. The objective function consists of a combination of smoothness measures across all considered simplicial levels, allowing for the incorporation of arbitrary smoothness criteria. This formulation enables the simultaneous estimation of edges and higher-order simplices within a single optimization problem. Experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed joint approach outperforms hierarchical and greedy baselines, while more faithfully enforcing higher-order structural priors.




## NodePro: An Instance-Level Profiling Framework for Graph-Structured Data


**Speaker**: [Tianqi Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g09j58gAAAAJ&hl=en)


**Location**: 0.W100 Turing Room, Building 28  

**Time**: 16:05 - 16:25

**Abstract**:  
Graph machine learning models often achieve similar overall performance yet behave differently at the node level—failing on different subsets of nodes with varying reliability. Standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy obscure these fine-grained differences, making it difficult to diagnose when and where models fail. We introduce NodePro, a node profiling framework that enables fine-grained diagnosis of model behavior by assigning interpretable profile scores to individual nodes. These scores combine data-centric signals—such as feature dissimilarity, label uncertainty, and structural ambiguity—with model-centric measures of prediction confidence and consistency during training. By aligning model behavior with these profiles, NodePro reveals systematic differences between models, even when aggregate metrics are indistinguishable. We show that node profiles generalize to unseen nodes, supporting prediction reliability without ground-truth labels. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of NodePro in identifying semantically inconsistent or corrupted nodes in a structured knowledge graph, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world settings.
